    <br>
    <h2>1. Understand The Goal Of Minesweeper</h2>
    <p> The goal of the game is to complete the board without detonating any mines. Think of yourself as part of a landmine detection unit whose sole job is to mark areas that are safe i.e., no bombs and mark areas that contain mines.</p>
  
  <br>
    <h2>2. Understand What The Mine Symbol Means In Minesweeper</h2>
    <p> Once you hit a mine, the board will reveal all the other hidden mines within the game. Thankfully, hitting a mine in Minesweeper is not so bad, as you can simply choose to play a new game</p>
<br>
<h2> 3. Understand What The Flag Symbol Means In Minesweeper</h2>
<p>A flag on a square means that there is a hidden mine within that square. These flags are placed by you, the ‘mine-detector,’ and should be used when you are sure of the location of the bomb. You don’t need to place the flags to win, but using them would certainly be easier than trying to keep track of the mines yourself. </p>
<br>
<h2>4. Understand What The Numbers Mean In Minesweeper</h2>
<p>The number gives you an indication of how many mines are located in the blocks adjacent to that specific, numbered block. </p>
